You can calculate an impression goal, CPM or budget, depending on which two fields have been entered:

The dollar symbol is a default value in the CPM and budget fields - I thought this was a nice visual reminder of the value type that goes in these fields. Even if you hit the reset button the dollar symbol reappears.

If all 3 fields have a value, an error message pops up:
