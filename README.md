You can calculate an impression goal, CPM or budget, depending on which two fields have been entered:

The dollar symbol is a default value in the CPM and budget fields - I thought this was a nice visual reminder of the value type that goes in these fields. Even if you hit the reset button the dollar symbol reappears.

If all 3 fields have a value, an error message pops up:

**Bugs/Errors

If a user enters text, program crashes - should be a simple fix I just haven't had time yet to fix it.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
